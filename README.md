# Multiple Linear Regression using Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of **Multiple Linear Regression**
to predict housing prices based on multiple independent variables.
The goal is to understand how different features collectively influence the target variable
and to evaluate the model performance using standard regression metrics.

---

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains housing-related features such as:
- Area
- Number of rooms
- Other relevant housing attributes

These features are used as independent variables to predict the **housing price**
(dependent variable).

---

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🔍 Steps Performed
1. Data loading and inspection  
2. Data preprocessing and cleaning  
3. Feature selection  
4. Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets  
5. Building the Multiple Linear Regression model  
6. Making predictions on test data  
7. Evaluating model performance  
8. Visualizing actual vs predicted values  

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using:
- **R² Score**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

A higher R² score indicates a better fit of the model to the data.

---

## 📊 Results
The results show a clear relationship between the independent variables
and the housing prices. The predicted values closely match the actual values,
indicating that the model performs well on the given dataset.

---

## 📚 Conclusion
Multiple Linear Regression was successfully implemented using Python.
The model effectively captures the relationship between multiple independent variables
and the target variable. This project demonstrates a clear understanding of
regression concepts, model building, and evaluation techniques.
